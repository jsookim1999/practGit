Architecture of Git
    1. Repository (commit)
    2. Staging index (add)
    3. Working

when git add, changes are added to staging index
From staging index, commit changes to the repository

This is important because after making 10 changes, 
I can selectively choose 5 changes to actually commit

git checkout: From the repository -> Working direcotry

Git does not use small tracking files throughout a repository. Everything is contained
within the .git directory in the top-level directory of the repository
